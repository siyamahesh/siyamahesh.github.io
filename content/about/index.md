**HI**
"My name is Siya and I am a senior in highschool. "
"I am interested in science subjects like biology and physics, but I also enjoy playing the guitar and Indian classical dance."

This blog website is a place for me to learn more about coding while also sharing important aspects of my life.

*Thank you to Dr. Tapas for getting me started with this blog and guiding me through everything even though I had almost no experience in coding. Thank you for your time and support!*
